# API Rate Limit Policy

Declarative knowledge: the public API gateway enforces a sliding-window rate
limit of 600 requests per minute per API key, with a burst allowance of 100.

## Rationale

The limit was set after observing sustained abuse traffic. It balances
legitimate batch consumers against gateway saturation.

## Relationships

- derived-from [Rate Spike Incident](/episodic/incident-2026-01-rate-spike.md)
- relates-to [Rotate API Keys](/procedural/rotate-api-keys.md)
